# go-w-tests

This Repo is configured to work within gitpod allowing for a consistent workspace and cli. This is handled and configured through the .giitpod.yml file and my personal dotfiles pulled from Github and used within a given instance. This allows me to use Neovim with my preffered config as well as any other dependencies I may need (or if this is completed at the time this is read 'have needed') to install for the Go with Tests assignments. For example you may notice pnpm files and a node modules folder. This is to provide tree-sitter for lsp support within the neovim editor, providing me with an experience on par with traditional IDE'S.

Until this is complete i will be updating and changing the gitpod yaml file as I find more efficient ways of using it and also as my needs changenot just for this repo but for future go projects as I see this file as something i may be able to reuse parts of as I work with Go more and more. This repo serves as both a way to save my work over time as well as a repo i can come back to for refreshers from time to time. As well as a good excuse to play around with gitpod, and, by extension, tools like docker and tailscale in order to keep my devops and terminal knowledge 'Mentos Fresh'.(its also if im being honest evidence that I taught myself Go).
